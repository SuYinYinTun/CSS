			<p class="textalign">There are two types of video connectors; Analog and Digital. VGA is the analog type that is used from 1987. DVI is the digital type that is more commonly used today. VGA connector is suit with CRT monitor but for LCD monitor, it has some problems. The video data is digital. To send data to VGA connector, it needs to change analog. When the data is on LCD monitor, it also needs to transfer data; analog to digital. It causes the video to be low quality and color. If so, the newer graphics cards have built with DVI connector. </p>
